The 'src' folder contains three sub-folders

* **cloud-to-device-console-app** - This folder contains a Python app that enables you to invoke direct methods of Live Video Analytics on IoT Edge module, with parameters defined by you in a JSON file (operations.json).
* **edge** - This folder has a few IoT Edge deployment manifest templates, along with sample code for an IoT Edge module (under 'modules' folder) that can be used in conjunction with the Live Video Analytics on IoT Edge module.
* **ams-asset-player** - This folder contains a Python app that showcases how you can playback assets recorded by Live Video Analytics on IoT Edge (in the Azure Media Services account referenced in the module twin properties).

## Prerequisites

1. An active Azure subscription
2. Azure resources deployed in the Azure subscription

    a. IoT Hub

    b. Storage Account

    c. Media Services

    d. Azure container registry

3. A Linux edge device with [IoT Edge runtime](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/how-to-install-iot-edge-linux)

4. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on your development machine with following extensions

    a. [Azure IoT Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.azure-iot-tools)

    b. [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)

5. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) on your development machine

You can use the [LVA resources setup script](https://github.com/Azure/live-video-analytics/tree/master/edge/setup) to deploy the Azure resources mentioned above, along with an Azure Linux VM to serve as your IoT Edge device.
